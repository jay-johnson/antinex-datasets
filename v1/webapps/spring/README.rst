Protecting Spring with a Deep Neural Network
============================================

This guide is a walkthrough for preparing and training a deep neural network for defending Spring application servers. The accuracy is currently **66%** without tuning the DNN or adding in actual exploits or sql-injection attacks into the attack datasets. Please note the ``non-attack`` training data is recorded from a multi-user simulation against a Django application server. Sorry I have not had enough free time to create a true Spring non-attack dataset (PRs welcome though!). 

In the future I am looking to extend the full datasets to include the TCP payload data stream (hex bytes) for sentiment analysis using an embedding Keras layer (https://blog.keras.io/using-pre-trained-word-embeddings-in-a-keras-model.html). I imagine deserialized payloads will only increase the default accuracy, but it is only an assumption for now.

Setup
-----

#.  Run these commands to clone the repositories to the same directories for making debugging easier for all users.

    ::

        git clone https://github.com/jay-johnson/train-ai-with-django-swagger-jwt.git ~/train-ai-with-django-swagger-jwt
        git clone https://github.com/jay-johnson/network-pipeline-datasets.git /opt/datasets
        git clone https://github.com/jay-johnson/antinex-datasets.git /opt/antinex-datasets

#.  Start the REST API

    If the REST API is not running, please start it in a new terminal so it can process the prepare and training requests.

    ::

        cd ~/train-ai-with-django-swagger-jwt
        source ~/.venvs/venvdrfpipeline/bin/activate
        ./install.sh
        ./start.sh

(Optional) Prepare Attack Dataset
---------------------------------

If you want to prepare your own attack dataset run these commands with the REST API running locally:

::

    source ~/.venvs/venvdrfpipeline/bin/activate
    export TEST_DATA=/opt/antinex-datasets/v1/webapps/spring/configs/spring-attack-prepare-v1.json
    ~/train-ai-with-django-swagger-jwt/tests/build-new-dataset.py

Check the files were updated:

::

    ls -l /opt/antinex-datasets/v1/webapps/spring/inputs/attack/
    total 13772
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 jay jay     2080 Feb 15 11:18 cleaned_v1_spring_attack_metadata.json
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 jay jay     2451 Feb 15 11:18 fulldata_v1_spring_attack_metadata.json
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 jay jay  1356260 Feb 15 11:18 v1_spring_cleaned_attack.csv
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 jay jay 12731474 Feb 15 11:18 v1_spring_full_attack.csv

(Optional) Prepare Full Dataset
-------------------------------

If you want to prepare your own full dataset run these commands with the REST API running locally:

::

    source ~/.venvs/venvdrfpipeline/bin/activate
    export TEST_DATA=/opt/antinex-datasets/v1/webapps/spring/configs/spring-prepare-v1.json
    ~/train-ai-with-django-swagger-jwt/tests/build-new-dataset.py

Confirm Dataset is Ready
------------------------

::

    /opt/antinex-datasets/tools/describe-v1-training.py /opt/antinex-datasets/v1/webapps/spring/training-ready/v1_spring_cleaned.csv 

Hopefully your dataset has both attack and non-attack records like:

::

    2018-02-15 11:19:42,038 - describe-training-data - INFO - total records=32000 attack=10800 nonattack=21200 percent_attack=33.75% percent_nonattack=66.25%

What you don't want to see is this in the output:

::

    2018-02-15 08:47:41,389 - describe-training-data - INFO - total records=21200 attack=0 nonattack=21200 percent_attack=0.00% percent_nonattack=100.00%

That means the prepare step failed to add the attack data into the dataset correctly. Please go back to the ``Prepare Dataset`` step and review paths to the files are correct.

Train Dataset
-------------

::

    source ~/.venvs/venvdrfpipeline/bin/activate
    export TEST_DATA=/opt/antinex-datasets/v1/webapps/spring/configs/spring-train-v1.json
    ~/train-ai-with-django-swagger-jwt/tests/create-keras-dnn.py

From the logs taken during creation of this doc, the model is 66% accurate at predicting attack records.
